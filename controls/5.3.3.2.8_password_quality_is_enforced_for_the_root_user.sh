Settings observe an order of precedence:
o module arguments override the settings in the
/etc/security/pwquality.conf configuration file
o settings in the /etc/security/pwquality.conf configuration file
override settings in a .conf file in the
/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/ directory
o settings in a .conf file in the /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/
directory are read in canonical order, with last read file containing the
setting taking precedence
It is recommended that settings be configured in a .conf file in the
/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/ directory for clarity, convenience, and
durability."
    local RISK="Unknown"
    local DESC="If the pwquality enforce_for_root option is enabled, the module will return error on
failed check even if the user changing the password is root.
This option is off by default which means that just the message about the failed check is
printed but root can change the password anyway.
Note: The root is not asked for an old password so the checks that compare the old and
new password are not performed.

Rationale:
Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to
compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the
effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.
Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack
a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of possible
combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised."
